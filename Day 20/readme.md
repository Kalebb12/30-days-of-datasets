# Day 20 — Global Disaster Dataset (2018–2024)

## **Overview**

The **Global Disaster Dataset (2018–2024)** offers a comprehensive record of natural and environmental disasters across the world. Each row represents a unique disaster event, documenting its characteristics, impacts, and the effectiveness of post-disaster responses. This dataset provides an opportunity to understand global disaster patterns, evaluate humanitarian responses, and identify regions most affected by severe events.

## **Objectives for Day 20**

* Explore global disaster frequency between **2018 and 2024**.
* Analyze how many disaster events are recorded, and how does their frequency change from 2018 to 2024?
* Which disaster type is the most common, and why might certain types dominate specific regions?
* Identify most-affected countries and high-risk zones using geospatial indicators.

## **Unanswered Questions for Future Work**

### **Geographic Distribution**

* Mapped events using latitude and longitude.
* Determined countries with the highest disaster counts and most severe impacts.

### **Severity vs Impact Relationship**

* Compared severity index with casualties and economic loss.
* Visualized which disaster types tend to be the deadliest or most costly.

### **Response & Recovery Analysis**

* Investigated how response delays affect efficiency scores.
* Explored whether higher aid amounts reduce recovery time.
* Compared response efficiency across countries.
