# Day 19 — Rollercoaster Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Overview

Day 19 of the 30 Days of Datasets challenge focuses on exploring the **Rollercoaster Database** from Kaggle. The dataset contains details about rollercoasters across the world, including their physical features, manufacturers, design elements, and performance metrics.

This analysis was conducted using the provided Jupyter Notebook, which includes data understanding, preparation, and feature exploration.
